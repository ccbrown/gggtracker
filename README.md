# Welcome! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ccbrown/gggtracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ccbrown/gggtracker)

This is the repository for [gggtracker.com](https://gggtracker.com). If there's something you think the site is missing, please either a.) open an issue to request the feature or b.) develop the feature yourself and put in a pull request.

### Development

If you have Go installed, you can develop and run the server in the usual way: `go get ./... && go generate ./... && go run main.go`

The server will only track Reddit by default. To track the forums, you'll need to use the `--forumsession` argument.

Before creating any pull requests, please run `make pre-commit` to format and test your changes.

### Deployment

The easiest way to deploy is using Docker: `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 ccbrown/gggtracker`
